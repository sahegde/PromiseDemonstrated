# PromiseDemonstrated

Here i have explained Promises in 2 parts:

1) power of Promises in node.js, for handling a series of aysnchronous calls on server side.
2) an example of a series of async calls can be made in browser.

To get started go through the following documentation : 

- http://www.sitepoint.com/overview-javascript-promises

for more insight into how you can chain a series of async calls go through the below example

- 

Go through this npm module to gain an understanding on how Promises can be implemented using the npm package - promise

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/promise
- 

a very handy guide to setup an app for usage of npm

- 
This MDN link of chaining of promises gives a straight forward idea on how .then function itself returns a promise which helps in further chaining.

 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then
 - 
 

Last but not the least go through my examples on promise which i have implemented both on nodejs (promiseNode.js) as well as the browser(promiseBrowser.html)
